!This is an example of a double line graph plotting the high and low temps (in F) of Crawfordsville for each month!
!Data: https://weatherspark.com/y/14785/Average-Weather-in-Crawfordsville-Indiana-United-States-Year-Round!
!This creates a list of tuples of the highs with their respective months!
highs := [["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"]:[35,39,51,63,73,81,84,82,76,64,51,39]];
!This creates a list of tuples of the lows with their respective months!
lows := [["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"]:[21,24,34,44,54,63,66,63,56,45,36,26]];
!This is a call to create a graph, all calls are all caps and this one takes in two sets of data, hence the double line!
